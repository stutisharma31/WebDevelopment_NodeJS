# WebDevelopment_ReactJS
Overview
This repository contains the source code and project files for Web Development using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine. The project showcases building back-end services and APIs, handling HTTP requests, connecting to databases, and implementing modern server-side web development practices with Node.js.

Features
Express.js Framework: Efficient routing, middleware integration, and API development using Express.js.
RESTful API: Creating and handling RESTful routes for communication between the client and server.
Database Integration: Connecting and querying databases (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) to manage persistent data.
User Authentication: Implementation of user login and signup using authentication strategies like JWT or OAuth.
Middleware: Custom middleware for request validation, error handling, and logging.
Environment Variables: Secure and configurable setup using environment variables (dotenv).
Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
Express.js: Fast and minimal web framework for Node.js.
JavaScript (ES6+): Modern JavaScript features used in the back-end logic.
MongoDB/MySQL: Database systems for storing application data.
JWT/OAuth: User authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Postman/Insomnia: API testing tools for local development
